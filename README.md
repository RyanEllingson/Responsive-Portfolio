The purpose of this project was to create a portfolio that utilizes bootstrap CSS and a mobile-responsive layout.  The content of the portfolio includes 3 web pages that are linked together using a nav bar.  One page has a picture of me along with some information about me; the second page is has a group of pictures with captions, and the third page has a form where you would enter a name, email address, and a message, along with a submit button (which doesn't actually do anything).

Mobile-responsiveness is accomplished by using a grid layout.  There are columns on the left and right of the pages that change size at different breakpoints, disappearing entirely on an "xs" browser size.  I experimented changing the browser window to see if the web page ever looked bad at any width, and changed the column sizes at additional breakpoints to try to make the pages look good no matter what width the browser is.  I also made it so the picture on the About Me page disappears entirely once the window gets small enough.  Additionally, even if a particular screen size didn't cause objects on the page to flow into each other, I tried to adjust column widths so there was a visually appealing amount of space occupied by each element on the page.
